        <p>Hi there. I'm a freelance Web Developer that specializes in Squarespace. If you want some extra customization for your page, or you want someone to set it up the first time, I'm your guy! For the past 8 months, I've been creating Squarespace sites for businesses of all sizes. No project is too big or too small. My specialty is to consult with you to set up and design your page and then train and hand off the page for you to continue on your own with minimal help going forward. I'm also available to do recurring work updating your page regularly as well as one on one training sessions.</p>
